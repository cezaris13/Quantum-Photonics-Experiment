# Quantum-Photonics-Experiment

This repository documents the experimental component of the *Introduction to Quantum Information Science* course at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The focus is on single-photon photonic qubits, encompassing their generation, detection, and characterization.

## Overview

In this course, we explore the principles and applications of quantum photonics through hands-on experiments that illustrate the behavior and manipulation of single-photon states. Key topics include:

- **Single-Photon Spectroscopy**

- **Decay Testing**
  
- **Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) Effect**: Measuring photon correlations to distinguish between classical and quantum light sources.

- **Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) Interference**: Investigating two-photon interference to study photon indistinguishability and quantum coherence.
